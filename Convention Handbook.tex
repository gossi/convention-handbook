\chapter{Introduction}

This is a short guide on how to run your own (small) unicycle convention (up to 
~150 participants). This guide is split into three parts. The first contains 
information about the organization of such a convention and what you as a host 
must do. Second part is about the convention itself. What program is running and 
what you need for it. Third part addresses the accounting for the convention and 
has some numbers ready for you to calculate with. The fourth part contains the 
specialities of a Freestyle Convention and what rules apply for such a 
convention.

\chapter{Organization}

This chapter focusses on the organizing things that happens mostly before the 
convention starts.

\section{Organizing Order}

Organizing a convention is not a linear process. Some tasks depend on others and 
some are interdependent. Although here is a rough order in which these steps may 
approached.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item There are two items you can parallelize at the beginning
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Feasibility study
			\item Get your stuff together
		\end{itemize}
	\item Find locations
	\item Find suppliers for food & drinks
	\item Set up a website w/ registration
\end{enumerate}

All items on this list are described in detail in the following sections.

\section{Feasibility Study}

The first thing when starting to organize a convention is to run a feasibility 
study to check for yourself if you verify as a host. This includes:

\begin{itemize}
	\item checking the location - if there is any and if validates as a host for 
	your expected amount of audience.
	\item talking to friends ask them if they would support you and join the 
	organizing team.
	\item check your organizing structures whether you are legally eligible for 
	hosting the convention.
\end{itemize}

\section{Team Up!}

You better have a team around you, that handles various tasks to support you. 
Some important positions are:

\begin{description}
	\item [Purchase] \hfill \\
	A person or a team that handles all the purchases for materials that are needed 
	for such a convention.
	\item [Accommodation] \hfill \\
	A team that organizes all the on-site accommodation.
	\item [Account-Manager] \hfill \\
	A person keeping track of all the registration fees.
	\item [Online Presence] \hfill \\
	A person who is responsible for the online presence and takes care of the 
	online registration.
\end{description}
Remark: Multiple positions can be filled by the same person.

\subsection{Helper Plan}
You should create a plan when which tasks need to be done. You can print this 
schedule and let helpers fill in their own name to claim those tasks. Your 
helpers need to have a task assigned, anyway they run around like beheaded 
chickens.

\section{Locations}

Make sure your convention has good locations, here's what you'd better be 
looking for.

\subsection{Riding Location / Gym}

A riding location is a must. For freestyle events preferably a gym. For outdoor 
events good spots are required. Make sure the locations can host the expected 
amount of riders plus audience.

\subsection{Accommodation}
Athletes need to sleep somewhere. Most of them are comfortable with their 
sleeping mattress and sleeping bag, just provide them a stay for that. However, 
depending on your facilities you might provide them different options during 
registration. Here are some possibilities:

\begin{description}
	\item [Sleeping Hall/Gym] \hfill \\ 
		This would be the easiest type of accommodation from the perspective of a 
		participant. Offering sleeping places may also be included in the 
		registration fee.
	\item [External] \hfill \\
		Accommodation can forwarded to external suppliers. You can make a deal 
		with those on the expected over-night guests to get a discount for your 
		participants (e.g. Youth hostels or hotels). Depending on your external 
		suppliers and provided options by them, include them in the registration 
		with their respective additional costs.
\end{description}

\section{Food \& Drinks}
Athletes need to eat and drink.

\subsection{Food}
Food includes three meals per day: breakfast, lunch and dinner. What you offer 
may depend on your provided accommodation. If you house all participants for an 
over-night stay you should at least provide breakfast. Lunch and dinner can be 
outsourced to a party service of your choice. See \fullref{sec:Accounting}
with estimates for required calculations on those.

\subsection{Drinks}
If you decided to provide drinks, then make sure you have enough water 
(without sparkles). Provide cups and pencils, so participants claim one, write 
their name on it and use it throughout the day. Other drinks are bonus and are 
experienced as a present of those kind hosts.

\section{Insurance}

Make sure, you checked the insurance thing. It may be enough to hand this off to 
every participant. When you have rented gyms or any other buildings, check that 
you comply with the fire emergency rules. 

\chapter{Convention Programm}

\section{Workshops}
Workshops are a good way to teach your participants new skills or get in contact 
with each other on shared activities. They are good as an addendum to your 
convention or even can turn up to be the whole concept.

\chapter{Freestyle Convention}

The concept for a freestyle convention was invented by Felix Dietze and Thomas 
Gossmann. Mainly because at that time there were only freestyler competitions.
At competitions only one or two riders are performing while the others aren't 
allowed to. We wanted the opposite, we wanted a gym full of freestylers riding, 
laughing, learning, talking and sharing unicycling with each other. That's why 
we invented the concept for a freestyle convention.

The more you need to organize as a participant the less likely people are 
joining. From other conventions we identified two things we wanted to neglect 
for the freestyle convention.
First is the need to manage your over-night stay on your own. In our opinion the 
host should provide accommodation. As freestylers we often declare gyms as our 
home and providing a place in a gym for your mattress and sleeping bag is 
sufficient enough. Also people stay in one place and socialize in the evening.
Second is food: When people need to manage their food on their own, they form 
groups to organize something but a good friend sometimes is left out just because 
he wasn't at the right place at the right time. In our opinion the food is 
provided by the host, keeping people together let them eat all at the same time 
which will lead to more time they can spent together with many others on their 
unicycles.

\section{Freestyle Convention Guidelines}

That leads us to the creation of guidelines for a freestyle convention:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Host provides a sleeping place (a gym is absolutely fine)
	\item Host provides food, this includes breakfast, lunch and dinner
	\item Host provides drinks (water is absolutely fine; more is bonus)
	\item A weekend full of workshops, because riders are coming to learn from 
	others
	\item No official competitions (though, small and funny ones in form of 
	workshops are allowed)
\end{itemize}
